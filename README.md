Autumn is a Java (8+) parser combinator library written with an unmatched feature
set:

- Bundles pre-defined parsers and combinators for most common use cases
- Write your own parsers with regular Java code
- Support for both scannerless parsing and a separate lexing/tokenization step
- Support for parsing both text strings and lists of objects
- Associativity support for operators
- Left-recursion support
- Context-sensitive parsing **(exclusive !!)**
- Reasonably fast (5x slower than (the very fast) ANTLR)
- Thoroughly documented
- Small & clean codebase

Examples:

- [JSON Grammar](/examples/norswap/lang/json/JSON.java)
- [Java Grammar](/examples/norswap/lang/java/Grammar.java)
